Our project is a smart scheduling assistant designed to help students coordinate study sessions with peers. The application includes a calendar system where users can sync their google calendars and view their own availability. This app will also allow people to add friends from their course, and use an AI-powered assistant to identify mutually available time slots for collaborative learning.

By focusing on improving how students plan and engage in group study, the tool encourages better time management, productivity, and peer-to-peer support â€” all key aspects of modern learning.

The app features a JavaFX-based GUI, user authentication, persistent calendar and friend data storage, and natural language interaction for scheduling queries.
