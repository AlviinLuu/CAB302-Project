Idea: "Uni Calendar Manager: The Ultimate Student Calendar"
Synopsis:
Develop a smart calendar management tool designed to help university students efficiently plan their schedules. This app syncs all calendars—including work calendars, Google Calendar, and university calendars—into one unified display. Students can also manually input events, sync schedules with friends, receive reminders, and check in after events for journaling. The goal is to provide a seamless, all-in-one calendar experience that simplifies student life and improves time management.

Key Features:
Ultimate Calendar Sync – Combines work calendars, Google Calendar, and university calendars into one easy-to-view display.

Assignment Starter Feature – Suggests the best times to start planning, drafting, and working on assignments.
